# GCloudMindMap
An attempt to build a mindmap of gcloud commands

I am using FreeMind to edit this locally: http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

Update: I have now added the [webspyder.py](webspyder.py) python 2.7 script which will crawl the GCloud documentation and build the MindMap automatically.  This still needs some refinement (it currently does not dig any deeper the command level; ideally I would like to extract the arguments as well) but it has the advantage that it a least provides a link to every command.  An example of the auto-generated mindmap is given in [gcloud_autogen.mm](gcloud_autogen.mm).
