# GCloudMindMap
An attempt to build a mindmap of gcloud commands.

The main mindmap is [gcloud.mm](gcloud.mm).

I am using FreeMind to edit this locally: http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

Update: I have now added the [webspyder.py](webspyder.py) python 2.7 script which will crawl the GCloud documentation and build the MindMap automatically.  This currently does not dig any deeper than the command level (i.e. it does not extract the arguments).  An example of the auto-generated mindmap is given in [gcloud_autogen.mm](gcloud_autogen.mm).  I am using this auto-generated mindmap as the basis for the full mindmap (which contains additional, manually added comments).
